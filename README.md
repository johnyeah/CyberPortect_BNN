# CyberProtect_bnn

The project aims to validate the safety state of Human-Robot-Collaboration by using Bayesian models. Bayesian models includes Bayeian networks and Bayesian neural networks. 


## Files
Mainly, the files in the project is displayed in following:
* **naive Bayes classifier:**   
Gaussian naive Bayes, Bernoulli naive Bayes, Multinomial naive Bayes.
roc-curve

* **nn:**   
neural network

* **bnn:**   
bayesain neural network
> File **bnn_simple** is a simple way to create and build bnn algorithm, but with low accuracy.


## dataset
The dataset is generated from MuJoCo-Simulation envrionment in form of `.csv`. The file path used in the project is given as shown in following:  
* static obstacle csv file   
FILE_PATH_TRAIN_static = '191217_test_record_iter_fix_static1.csv'    

* dynamic obstacle csv file  
FILE_PATH_TRAIN_dynamic = 'test_record_iter_fix_static.csv'
